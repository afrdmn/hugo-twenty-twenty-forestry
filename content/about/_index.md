_The Cornell Independent_ is dedicated to uncovering sharp, intelligent insights into the world’s foremost challenges. While we do not pursue a particular political agenda, we are not apolitical and we do not take a middle road. We are firm but cordial, bipartisan but not equivocal. We understand the limits of a globalized economic and political system, though we are committed to respect and admiration for all peoples and cultures.

Though we understand and even cherish disagreement, we are optimistic that a shared commitment to patriotism and democracy will prevail above all else. Our vision promises an understanding of all perspectives and a deep commitment to nuance, though we recognize that fact and opinion are vociferously separate.

Our opinions may be completely contradictory to one another and will generally challenge conventional wisdom. That is the nature of an independent voice. However, no matter the severity of disagreement, we recognize that we are all American patriots, committed to the “truth,” the rule of law, our friends, families, and communities, and democratic governance.
