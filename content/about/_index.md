The _Cornell Progressive_ is Cornell University’s premier progressive news and opinion publication and blog.

Established in 2000 as _Turn Left_, the name was changed in 2007 to the current _Cornell Progressive_. During the 2000 presidential campaign between Al Gore and George W. Bush, a trio of engineers sat in Noyes (hardly the modern recreation center of today) discussing politics when the idea came up to create a publication. At the time, the _Cornell Review_ was a powerful, monolithic political voice on campus. “We wanted to counterbalance that,” according to founder Tsee Yuan Lee ’02.

Along with his brother Tsee Yung Lee ’02, both computer science engineers, the two Lees maintained a personal website (thehypeof.com — now defunct) that included a politics section. Thomas Leung ’02, a civil engineer, suggested creating a campus organization so people actually would read their stuff. And so the publication still found all over campus was born.

The first issue on the eve of the 2000 election was a bound magazine. All subsequent editions have been in newspaper format.

**In 2016 the publication went completely dark. A strange time for a progressive paper to go "lights out" amid a progressive resurgence in American politics. Not to mention the emergence of a real threat to the very nature of American democracy and the existence of a multi-racial democracy. The demise of _The Cornell Progressive_ speaks to the disarray that can sometimes plague politics on the left. But we can change that.**

In 2021, _The Cornell Progressive_ is up and running again. We have a lot of work to do — to pressure lawmakers to stand up to the dominance of the corporate elites in American life and to channel the energy of young people into sustainable movements and policy achievements.
